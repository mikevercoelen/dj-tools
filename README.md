# dj-tools
Searches the internet for 320kbps mp3 files, download them, and optionally burn them to disk. It's the perfect solution for DJ's still using cd's.

It's using Soulseek under the hood, so please setup an account.

This repo is for educational purposes only, we don't support illegal downloading and you should always support artists by buying tracks, checkout [Beatport](http://beatport.com).

## Getting started

First copy example env file, and set your Soulseek credentials, if you don't have them yet, download Soulseek, install it, and create an account. Use that account here.

```
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm start
```

That's it.

## Future

Currently working on an Electron version, so we can easily find high quality mp3 tunes, download the and optionally burn them.
